❓ Quiz Game

Overview:

Quiz Game is an interactive, browser-based application that presents users with multiple-choice questions and tracks their score in real time. The project focuses on application state management, conditional logic, and user interaction flow using vanilla JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how logic, state, and UI work together in a complete interactive experience.

Features:

Multiple-choice quiz questions

Real-time score tracking

Dynamic question rendering

Immediate feedback on user selections

Simple, intuitive user interface

Tech Stack:

HTML5 – semantic structure

CSS3 – styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – application logic and state control

How to Run Locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/baconlord102/quiz-game.git


Navigate into the project directory

Open index.html in your browser

No additional setup is required.

Application Logic:

Questions are stored in structured JavaScript objects or arrays

The current question index and score are tracked in application state

User selections trigger event handlers that evaluate correctness

The UI updates dynamically based on quiz progress

What This Project Demonstrates:

Control flow and conditional logic

Managing application state without frameworks

Event-driven programming

Dynamic DOM updates

Building interactive user experiences

Future Improvements:

Add question categories or difficulty levels

Persist high scores using localStorage

Add a progress indicator

Implement a quiz restart option

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

Purpose:

This project was built to strengthen core JavaScript skills by creating an interactive application that requires coordination between logic, state, and UI updates.
